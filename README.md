# Getting Started

Welcome to your new project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | content for UI frontends goes here
`approuter/` | approuter routes go here
`db/` | your domain models and data go here
`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide

## First step
first install the following npm package
```npm i -g recursive-install```
open terminal, and in root folder install all dependecies via
```npm install:all ```

## Initial deployment
to deploy you can open git bash terminal and use 
``` mbt build && cf deploy mta_archives/allmyorders_1.0.0.mtar ```

## note
make sure to access endpoints using app router. if you directly access service you will not be authorized. app router url can be found in the applications within the space
## for local runs
after succesfull deployment you can test your changes locally by following the steps listed below.
you would need to run individual modules seperately.
first check if you have relevant plugins installed using
``` cf plugins ```
if you dont have default-env plugin installed
please install using following command
``` cf install-plugin DefaultEnv ```

### running approuter locally
open a new git bash terminal and execute
``` cd approuter && cf default-env ordermonitoring-approuter ```
this will create a default-env.json file in approuter folder with credential details from BTP
now you just need to run the approuter using the following command
``` npm run start ```
### running service locally
to run service locally, first update default-env.json in the root folder using the following command
``` cf default-env allmyorders-srv ```
your enviornment variables would be packed in default-env.json file in root.
you can now run your application in local mode using 
```cds watch/run ```
result would be coming from data stored in BTP

### Important Note
if you redploy anything, you need to update default-env.json files as mentioned above.

## Deploy Individual modules
### Deploying HTML5/FIORI Apps

open terminal and run following command
``` cf html5-list ```
this will give you a list of html5 apps deployed. copy the apphostId
using the copied apphost id write the following command
``` mkdir html5 && cd html5 && cf html5-get --all ```
this will generate .zip file of all deployed html5 apps
now navigate to the app where you want to make a change. for eg, app/allorders by using the following command from root and build the module once via following commands
``` cd app/allorders && npm run build:cf ```
after the built is complete, you will see a dist folder. copy that folder and past it in html5 folder previously created, and delete the .zip file for allOrders that was previously available in the folder
now deploy your changes by using following command from root.
``` cd html5 && cf html5-push -r ```
this will deploy all apps in html5 folder to BTP html5 repo. therefore please note that you should only delete the app for which you want to make a change.

### deploying backend CDS Changes
from the root run the following command
``` cds build ```
once the build has been completed, you can push your changes via following command
``` cf push allmyorders-srv ```

## Usefull commands
To login quickly via terminal you can use the following command
```cf.exe login -a "https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com" --sso-passcode "PASSCODE" ```

you can get passcode by opening following url in browser
https://login.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/passcode#
